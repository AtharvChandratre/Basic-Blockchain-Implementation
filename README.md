# Basic Blockchain Implementation
This is an implementation of a basic blockchain written in JavaScript, aiming to understand the fundamentals of what makes a blockchain secure by using the SHA256 encryption algorithm.

This is to test my understanding of the blockchain protocol and is neither complete nor secure.

It contains:
- The basic implementation of a blockchain
- A simple proof-of-work mechanism
- A basic mining reward system
